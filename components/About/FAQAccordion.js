        'MILES tokens are a planned cryptocurrency token ("SMT") operating on the Steem Blockchain with functionality similar to STEEM, but with a rewards pool exclusively for TravelFeed posts. On top of earning more curation rewards and giving an account more influence over the MILES rewards pool, staking MILES tokens will give users access to several Premium features and additional revenue streams on TravelFeed. We will release more information on MILES in Q1 2020. We plan on rewarding past, current and future TravelFeed users and delegators by airdropping MILES to them, but we believe in building our platform first and with it a MILES economy deeply integrated into the platform, instead of launching a worthless token without a use case now.',

      content:
        'STEEM, and in the future the TravelFeed MILES tokens, are inflationary currencies with a yearly inflation of currently around 10%. A large part of the new STEEM tokens generated by inflation goes towards the rewards pool that is distributed among content creators and curators by giving smiles.',

        'On TravelFeed, you can upvote posts and comments by pressing the vote button and moving it. We call that "giving smiles". You can give up to 10 smiles per post, equaling a 100% upvote on Steem. The more smiles you give, the less powerful they are, but your "fuel tank" recharges by 100 smiles every day. The more smiles are given to a post, the more visibility it will get and the higher the reward that the author will get from the rewards pool. The rewards for a post are not only determined by the total amount of smiles received, but also by the influence (currently determined by Steem Power held) of each curator â€” one smile by a powerful account like @travelfeed can be worth more than ten smiles from a small account.',
