        5. Adult-Oriented Content
      </Typography>
      <p>
        TravelFeed is intended for a general audience and, as a result, some
        TravelFeed Content may discuss or depict adult-oriented topics. We
        realize that this content may not be appropriate or desirable for some
        of our readers depending on their current location, age, background or
        personal views. As a result, you, other TravelFeed users and in general
        all Steem blockchain users are expected to mark this content as Not Safe
        For Work (&quot;NSFW&quot;). But we prefer no Adult content at all on
        our platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The marking of Steem blockchain Content as &quot;NSFW&quot; does not
        guarantee the prevention of you (or other Steem blockchain users,
        including TravelFeed users) from being able to access this content but,
        instead, helps all users to make informed decisions about the type of
        content they prefer to view on TravelFeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible that some Steem blockchain users (inside and outside of
        TravelFeed) may not use the &quot;nsfw&quot; designation (mistakenly or
        purposefully) and thus you acknowledge that it is possible that you may
        still experience adult-oriented topics even while using the TravelFeed
        website or dApp. If you encounter any adult-oriented content on
        TravelFeed that is not marked as &quot;nsfw&quot;, we will remove access
        to this content from TravelFeed when notified.

        available, are free of viruses or errors, that its content is accurate,
        that it will be uninterrupted, or that defects will be corrected. We
        will not be responsible or liable to you for any loss of any kind, from
        action taken, or taken in reliance on material, or information,
        contained on the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subject to what is stated in paragraph &#39;Limitation of Liability&#39;
        below, any and all indemnities, warranties, terms and conditions
        (whether express or implied) are hereby excluded to the fullest extent
        permitted under applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not be liable, in contract, or tort (including, without
        limitation, negligence), other than where we have been fraudulent or
        made negligent misrepresentations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in these terms excludes or limits liability for death or
        personal injury caused by negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation, or
        any other liability which may not otherwise be limited or excluded under
        applicable law.

        9. The TravelFeed Services
      </Typography>
      <p>
        As described in more detail below, the services, among other things,
        provide in-browser (or otherwise local), dApp, software that (a)
        Generates and stores Steem account addresses and encrypted private keys
        (defined below), and (b) Facilitates the submission of Steem transaction
        data to the Steem network without requiring you to access the Steem
        command line interface.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Account names and private keys:</b> When you create an account, the
          services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key
          pair that you may use to send and receive Steem, Steem Dollars and
          tokens via the Steem network. The private key uniquely matches the
          account name and must be used in connection with the account name to
          authorize the transfer of Steem and Steem Dollars from that account.
          You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your
          private key and any password phrase associated with your wallet or
          TravelFeed account. You must keep your account, password phrase and
          private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in
          the loss of control of Steem, Steem Power, Steem Dollars, Miles Token
          associated with the wallet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>No Password Retrieval:</b> TravelFeed does not receive or store
          your account password, or the unencrypted keys and addresses.
          Therefore, we cannot assist you with account password retrieval.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        TravelFeed does not have account creation services however we do connect
        to third party systems that do. It is typical practice of third party
        new account creation services to provide you with tools to help you
        remember or recover your password, including by allowing you to set
        password hints, but even these services cannot generate a new password
        for your account. You are solely responsible for remembering your
        account password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any account
        Names and password pairs maintained in your account, you accept and
        acknowledge that any Steem, Steem Dollars, Steem Power or Miles Token
        you have associated with such account will become inaccessible if you do
        not have your account password.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Transactions:</b> In order to be completed, all proposed Steem
          transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Steem public ledger
          via the Steem distributed consensus network (a peer-to-peer economic
          network that operates on a cryptographic protocol), which is not
          owned, controlled or operated by TravelFeed. The Steem Network is
          operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties.
          TravelFeed has no control over the Steem network and therefore cannot
          and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via the
          services will be confirmed via the Steem network. You acknowledge and
          agree that the transaction details you submit via the services may not
          be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Steem network.
          You may use the services to submit these details to the network.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            No Storage or Transmission of Steem, Steem Dollars, Steem Power or
            Miles Token:
          </b>{' '}
          Steem, in any of its forms (Steem, Steem Dollars, Steem Power and
          Miles Token) is an intangible, digital asset. They exist only by
